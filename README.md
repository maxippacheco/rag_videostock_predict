# RAG for Video Stock Production with Pinecone and OpenAI

## Overview

This repository implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for video stock production, leveraging Pinecone for vector storage and OpenAI's models for content generation. The project is organized into a series of Jupyter notebooks, each serving a specific function in the video processing pipeline.

## Repository Structure

- `Pipeline_1_Generator_and_Commentator.ipynb`: Generates video content and provides commentary or annotations.
- `Pipeline_2_The_Vector_Store_Administrator.ipynb`: Manages the vector store for efficient data retrieval.
- `Pipeline_3_The_Video_Expert.ipynb`: Analyzes and processes video data as the expert system.
- `Video_dataset_visualization.ipynb`: Visualizes video datasets for data exploration and analysis.
